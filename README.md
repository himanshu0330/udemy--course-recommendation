## Project Description and Objectives

The Udemy Course Recommendation Engine is a prototype designed to provide personalized course recommendations to users based on their interests, previous engagements, and course ratings.

## Setup and Running Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., Python, Jupyter Notebook).
3. Download the Kaggle API token from the official Kaggle Website and place it in the `home` directory.
4. Run the Udemy*Course_Recommendation_Engine*.ipynb notebook to perform initial analysis and preprocessing.
5. Run the Udemy*Course_Recommendation_Engine*.ipynb notebook to test and evaluate the recommendation algorithm.

## Chosen Recommendation Model

For this project, I have implemented a content-based recommendation algorithm. This model recommends courses based on the content and features of the courses themselves, such as course titles, subjects, etc. The content-based approach was chosen due to its ability to provide personalized recommendations without relying on user interaction data, which can be sparse in some cases.
